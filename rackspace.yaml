  #### Logging in via SSH
  The private key provided in the passwords section can be used to login as
  root via SSH.  We have an article on how to use these keys with [Mac OS X and
  Linux](http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/logging-in-with-a-ssh-private-key-on-linuxmac)
  as well as [Windows using
  PuTTY](http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/logging-in-with-a-ssh-private-key-on-windows).
  #### Drone Configuration
  Drone's configuration is controlled using the DRONED_OPTS variable as defined in /etc/default/drone.
  #### Drone Service
  Drone can be controlled using the standard 'start' and 'stop' service commands.
  start drone
  stop drone
  #### SSL Configuration
  This setup provides a self signed SSL certificate with the server's IP address as the Common Name.
  To provide a new certificate, simply overwrite the two files in /etc/drone/ssl/ with your signed
  certificates.
  Restart Drone to apply the new certificate.
