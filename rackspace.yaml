  #### Welcome to Drone
  This will deploy a single Linux server running
  [Drone](https://github.com/drone/drone). Before you get started, create an
  admin user by accessing the Drone URL provided above.

  #### Logging in via SSH
  The private key provided in the passwords section can be used to login as
  root via SSH.  We have an article on how to use these keys with [Mac OS X and
  Linux](http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/logging-in-with-a-ssh-private-key-on-linuxmac)
  as well as [Windows using
  PuTTY](http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/logging-in-with-a-ssh-private-key-on-windows).

  #### Daemon Options
  Drone's configuration is controlled using the DRONED_OPTS variable as defined
  in /etc/default/drone. You can find some of the options in the [Drone
  Documentation](http://drone.readthedocs.org/en/latest/install.html).

  #### Web Interface
  There are many options you can configure in the web interface on your Drone
  instance. You will want to follow the [setup
  documentation](http://drone.readthedocs.org/en/latest/setup.html) to
  configure the basics.

  #### Drone Service
  Drone can be controlled using the standard 'start' and 'stop' service
  commands. You will need to restart drone if you modify the above
  configuration in /etc/default/drone.

  To restart Drone, issue these commands:
  stop drone
  start drone

  #### SSL Configuration
  This setup provides a self signed SSL certificate with the server's IP
  address as the Common Name. To provide a new certificate, simply overwrite
  the two files in /etc/drone/ssl/ with your signed certificates. Restart Drone
  to apply the new certificate.
